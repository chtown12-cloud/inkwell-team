## Deploy to Vercel (Free — Recommended)

This is the easiest way. Your app lives in the cloud, accessible from any device.

### Step 1: Get accounts (all free)

1. **GitHub**: Sign up at [github.com](https://github.com) if you don't have one
2. **Vercel**: Sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) using your GitHub account
3. **Anthropic API Key**: Get one at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) (for the photo scanning feature)

### Step 2: Push code to GitHub

Open a terminal (or use [GitHub's web upload](https://github.com/new)):

```bash
# Install git if needed: https://git-scm.com/downloads

cd inkwell
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Create a new repo on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/inkwell.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Or just drag-and-drop all the files into a new GitHub repository via the web interface.

### Step 3: Deploy on Vercel

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Click **Import** next to your `inkwell` repository
3. Click **Deploy** — Vercel auto-detects Next.js
4. After deploy, go to **Settings → Environment Variables**
5. Add: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` = your API key from Step 1
6. **Redeploy** from the Deployments tab (click the three dots → Redeploy)

Your app is now live at `https://inkwell-xxxx.vercel.app`! 🎉

### Step 4: Install on your Pixel 8

1. Open `https://your-app-name.vercel.app` in Chrome on your Pixel
2. Tap the **three dots menu** (⋮) in the top right
3. Tap **"Add to Home screen"** or **"Install app"**
4. It now appears on your home screen like a real app with its own icon

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | For photo scanning | Your Anthropic API key |

## Local Development (Optional)

If you ever want to run it locally:

```bash
cd inkwell
npm install
echo "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-..." > .env.local
npm run dev
```

Opens at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Tips

- **Notebook scanning works best** with clear handwriting, good lighting, and a contrasting background
- **On your phone**, use the camera button in the scan modal to take a photo directly
- Tasks are stored in your browser's localStorage — clearing browser data will erase them
- The app works offline after the first load (PWA caching), but photo scanning requires internet
